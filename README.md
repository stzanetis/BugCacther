## Printed Electronics for Smart Agriculture Applications
This project includes the design of electronic circuits and 3D printed circuits to create an insect control system in an agricultural environment. Using embedded systems such as ESP32 and cameras, insect photos will be sent to an AI model to estimate the health of a field.
